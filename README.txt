This repository contains the exclusive source code and builder for main danillonunes.net site.

Note that code developed outside danillonunes.net lives on their own servers and you should use the build script to fetch them.

You must have Git and Drush in order to use the build script.

To build the site, you must go to the repo root directory and run make. The site will be built on drupal directory. This proccess can take a while, if you want to rebuild it frequently, you should look for a cache solution.
